#### CODE REVIEW
#### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design
###### Description
For this project I decided to chose the artifact from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The artifact was part of the final project, which was to create a 3D render of an image. The image I chose to render was a air hockey table.
###### Justification
I chose this artifact as I felt it would allow me to change the original programs design from using GLUTs structure to using the GLFW structure.
###### Reflection
For my reflection on this artifacts enhancement, I learned how to do more with GLFW as it is definetly harder to implement certain structures than if I were to use GLUT.
